"Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself. My self Chinna Siva Krishna Thota, and Iâ€™m completed my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Swarnandhra College of Engineering and Technology, where I have maintained a CGPA of 7.75. Alongside my formal education, I am also enrolled in an Industry Ready Certification program in Full-Stack Development with Nxtwave Disruptive Technologies, which has helped me build practical expertise in modern web technologies.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong interest in AI, machine learning, and full-stack development, and I have been working on various personal projects to apply my skills. For example, I developed EClass, a student progress management platform that integrates both admin and client views, enabling users to track progress, course details, and announcements. Another significant project I worked on is the Auto Mock Interviews platform, built with the MERN stack, which helps MBA students book mentorship sessions based on their preferences and mentor availability.

I have also built several other applications, including a Blog Platform for managing posts with CRUD operations, a personalized Chatbot that engages users, and a custom Wikipedia search application, where users can easily fetch and view search results from Wikipedia. Each of these projects allowed me to deepen my knowledge of front-end technologies like React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

In addition to my technical skills, I have gained valuable internship experience as a Junior Software Engineer at VTS, where I worked on both the MERN stack and Spring Boot with React.js, contributing to the development of full-stack applications. My certifications in AI-ML and Cyber Security have also provided me with practical, hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model building, threat analysis, and vulnerability assessment.

Beyond my technical work, I have been involved in extracurricular activities like sports and drama, where I earned a medal in Kabaddi and a Drama Shield Award for my contributions to school productions. These experiences have helped me develop leadership, teamwork, and communication skills, which I believe are important in any professional setting.

In summary, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow my skills and contribute to innovative projects. I am excited about the chance to bring my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and enthusiasm for learning to your team."
